# Earning Your First Dollar

This repository is designed to help you earn your first dollar. If you're new to this, don't worry. I will share what I know, but keep in mind that there are many secrets out there.

## Starting with Small Interactions

You can begin by earning a little money through interactions with people. Payments will be sent to your PayPal account. If you have knowledge in cracking, configurations, or technology-related skills, you can sell them [here](https://passkurd.com/amine).

## Embracing Crypto and Capitalizing on Market Fluctuations

One strategy is to approach cryptocurrency like a game of chess. Place your less valuable pawns in front and back them up with more valuable components until you win or at least secure a draw. If you pay less attention to your adversaries, you might find yourself in a checkmate.

Here's the strategy:

1. Invest a small amount of money in select cryptocurrency pairs when the market is down or side ways you dont know he future  of coourse no body does.
2. If you have the courage, buy more when it's down every time and put bigger amount of money everytime, repeating this process until the value of what youre put increases, when the market is up a little bit you will recover youre capital.
3. If you have more funds to challenge the market follow the up trend , you might achieve significant wins. I have tested this strategy successfully in various pairs. Today, I had some wins testing this strategy with MATIC, AVAX, and ADA.

Remember, if you're a developer, you can potentially pay less for certain resources. (I'm adding this note to remember it later.)
